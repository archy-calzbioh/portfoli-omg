I used bootstrap and it implementation of flex to lay out the app. 

I adapted the jQuery text animation from a jsFiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/jb9mt/6/. 
This required the jQuery UI CDN for the effect method to work properly.

Shadows are disabled by default in bootstrap so I modified custom.scss to add shadows to div elements.

I used javascript to add visual effects for the active page tabs and to display new pages in the main div. 

The layout on the art page is from a bootstrap snippet.
