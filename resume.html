<p class="m-3">My passion for programming was sparked when I worked through "Learn Python The Hard Way".
Through this experience, I was able to develop a deep skill set with some of the math and science packages  that I used to optimize a portfolio resulting in a deeper understanding of algorithmic trading. That role inspired me to learn more about data science and I really became passionate about machine learning.</p>
<p class="m-3"> While I was a student at Laney I was  able to use my programming and math  skills to develop a highly successful linear algebra calculator.</p>
<p class="m-3">I find great satisfaction in being able to tackle logic problems and helping people to find novel solutions to complicated problems.Iâ€™m looking to launch a career in software engineering and work in a dynamic role with an innovative team working to solve modern societal problems.</p>
